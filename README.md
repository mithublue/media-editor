#### Installation note
There are config values in the config.php file in the root of the project,
almost all of them will be okay to start with. You have to change just 'root_url' 
config value. Its value should be the root url of the project. For example, if
the project is located at the url: http://example.com/project/folder, then the value of
'root_url' would be "http://example.com/project/folder"

Now, navigating to this url will be okay to work with it.
